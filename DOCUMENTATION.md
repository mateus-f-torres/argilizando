# Argilizando UX/UI

## Strategy

### What is Argilizando ?

* A faster, more streamlined approach to the character creation process in D&D 5e
* A homebrew version of the process that allows all races to be able to choose all classes, without penalties
* A quick lookup to most of D&D 5e rules, like, combat rules, conditions, and some homebrew rules

### What value does it provide ?

* Provides newcomers with a simple, step by step, way to create a character, abstracting all the minutiae and hidden one-liners in the **Player's Handbook**
* Provides oldtimers with easy access to those hard to remember and really specific rules
* Provides all players with the chance to mix and match any combination of race/class/background you want
  * Want to make a halfling barbarian ? Go for it
  * Goliath wizard kind of person ? More magical power to ya
  * Uh...what ? You want a lizardmen bard ? Ok I guess...you do you player
  
### User Research

* What they **expect** to do ?
  * Quickly and easy create the bulk of the character
  * Find that one rule that is stopping the table
  * Leave the app in charge of inventory tracking and other mechanical aspects of the game
* Why that **matters** to them ?
  * Because they want to play the game with their friends
  * Because taking 10min to find some rule or 1h to create a character is not fun
* What other **goals** they have ?
  * Create strange characters to roleplay as
  * Discover hidden dungeons and lost loot
  * Have simple dumb fun with some bizarre adventure the DM made for them
* What other **tools** they use ?
