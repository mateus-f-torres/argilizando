# Argilizando
Homebrew character creator for DnD 5e 

Argilizando is a helper for my DnD games. It provides me, my players and anyone else that uses it with my idea of a more streamlined approach to the character creation process. Allowing players to quickly make a rough draft of a character. In using this software it is implied that the user already owns or has access to books needed to truly flesh out and play with the character.

If you want a truly complete online tool, please try out https://www.dndbeyond.com/, the official digital toolset for Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition

## Usage
Argilizando will only truly enforce two rules:
1. To access the Create section you must lock your Race, Class, Ability Scores, and Background choices.
2. To access the Play! section your character must have at least a name.

Aside from these, Argilizando will not help you make a optimized character, as it is meant to be used in the table with others players and the DM.

## Contributing
Argilizando was my first big project.
All of it is self-taught, therefore, quite susceptible to the [Einstellung effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect).
Anyone wishing to point out flaws or better alternatives in code style, problem resolutions, bugs or anything in between, just clone it and open up a PR.
