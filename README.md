# Argilizando ![TravisCI build status](https://travis-ci.com/mateus-f-torres/boneco-de-argila.svg?branch=master)

[Argilizando](https://argilizando.herokuapp.com/) is a helper for my DnD games.  
It provides a more streamlined approach to the character creation process.   
Allowing players to quickly make a rough draft of a character.  
In using this software it is implied that the user already owns or has access to the books needed to actually play the game.

TODO: describe main features and how they make a streamlined process

If you are looking for a complete online tool, please try out https://www.dndbeyond.com/, the official digital toolset for Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition

## Online Usage
Access  https://argilizando.herokuapp.com/ and create your character draft.  
Argilizando will only truly enforce two rules:
1. To access the Create section you must lock your Race, Class, Ability Scores, and Background choices.
2. To access the Play! section your character must have at least a name.

Aside from these, Argilizando will not help you make a optimized character, as it is meant to be used in the table with others players and the DM.

## Local Development or Usage
1. clone repo
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn start`

The main scripts are:
1. `yarn start`, for local machines.
2. `yarn dev && yarn serve`, for online IDEs like C9.
3. `yarn build && yarn serve`, for production deployment.
